		This package provides FFI bindings for SSH2 client library named libssh2.
		
		As of version 0.2 all blocking is handled in Haskell code
		rather than in C code. This means that all calls are now
		interruptable using Haskell asynchronous exceptions; for
		instance, it is now possible to use &quot;System.Timeout&quot; in
		combination with &quot;libssh2&quot;.
		
		/Note on usage on Windows/: On Windows you MUST compile
		your executable with @-threaded@ or &#39;libssh2&#39; will NOT
		work. We have tested &#39;libssh2&#39; on Windows using
		&lt;http://mingw.org/&gt;, with &lt;http://www.openssl.org/&gt; and
		&lt;http://libssh2.org/&gt; compiled from source (be sure to pass
		the &#39;shared&#39; option to the configure script for &#39;openssl&#39;
		to enable the shared libraries).
